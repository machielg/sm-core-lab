    "### Advantages Over sagemaker-core ProcessingJob:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modern Framework Integration**\n",
    "   - Optimized for PyTorch-based workflows\n",
    "   - Uses latest PyTorch container images (2.0+)\n",
    "   - Better compatibility with modern ML libraries and tools\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automatic Dependency Management**\n",
    "   - `source_dir` automatically uploads `requirements.txt`\n",
    "   - Dependencies installed in container automatically\n",
    "   - No manual container configuration needed\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Built-in Convenience Features**\n",
    "   - `wait=True`: Automatic blocking until completion\n",
    "   - `logs=True`: Stream logs directly to notebook\n",
    "   - Cleaner API with less boilerplate\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **SDK Ecosystem Integration**\n",
    "   - Works seamlessly with other SDK components\n",
    "   - Can be used with PipelineSession for pipelines\n",
    "   - Integrates with SageMaker Experiments\n",
