## üèóÔ∏è Assignment 1: Basic Training Job

### üéØ Your Mission
Transform the local XGBoost training from the notebook into a cloud-based SageMaker Training Job using raw sagemaker-core components.

### ü§î What You Need to Figure Out

#### 1. Environment Setup
**Your Task:** Set up your SageMaker session and understand the sagemaker-core library structure.

**Research These Core Components:**
- `from sagemaker_core.helper.session_helper import Session, get_execution_role, s3_path_join`
- How does a `Session` object provide access to S3 and other AWS services?
- What does `get_execution_role()` return and why do you need it?
- How do you use `s3_path_join()` to build proper S3 paths?

**Getting Started Pattern:**
```python
from sagemaker_core.helper.session_helper import Session, get_execution_role, s3_path_join
import time

# Create your session
session = Session()

# Get your execution role  
role = get_execution_role()

# Create a timestamp for this experiment
timestamp = time.strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H-%M-%S", time.gmtime())
```

**Key Concept:** Use YOUR name in the training job name so you can find it in the console.

#### 2. Data Preparation Challenge  
**Your Task:** Upload your training data to S3 in a format the XGBoost container expects.

**Research Methods:**
- How does `session.upload_data(path)` work?
- What does `session.default_bucket()` return?
- How do you build S3 URIs using `s3_path_join()`?

**Data Format Investigation:**
- What format does SageMaker XGBoost expect? (Hint: Check the local notebook)
- Where should the target column be positioned?
- Should your CSV have headers?

**Your Challenge:** Build S3 paths manually
```python
# You'll need to construct paths like:
base_path = s3_path_join("s3://", session.default_bucket(), "your-experiment-folder")
train_s3_uri = session.upload_data("train.csv", key_prefix="your-experiment-folder")
```

**Common Mistake:** Forgetting that XGBoost expects the target column FIRST with no headers.

#### 3. Training Job Architecture
**Your Task:** Build a TrainingJob using sagemaker-core components.

**Research These Classes:**
- `sagemaker_core.resources.TrainingJob`
- `sagemaker_core.shapes.AlgorithmSpecification`
- `sagemaker_core.shapes.Channel`
- `sagemaker_core.shapes.ResourceConfig`

**Debugging Hints:**
- If training fails immediately: Check your data format
- If container can't find data: Verify your Channel configuration
- If you get permissions errors: Check your IAM role

**Questions to Answer:**
1. What's the difference between `training_input_mode="File"` vs `"Pipe"`?
2. Why do we need both train and validation channels?
3. How does `StoppingCondition` prevent runaway costs?

#### 4. Getting the XGBoost Image
**Your Task:** Get the correct XGBoost container image URI.

**Research This:**
- Look up `sagemaker.image_uris.retrieve()` function
- What parameters does it need? (framework, region, version, etc.)
- How do you get your current AWS region from the session?

**Your Challenge:** Build this yourself
```python
from sagemaker import image_uris

# You need to figure out:
# - How to get region from your session
# - What framework name to use for XGBoost  
# - Version 1.7-1 is required
```

**Think About:** Why does SageMaker use container images instead of installing packages?

### üîç Debugging Common Issues

**"No module named ..." errors:**
- Check your imports match the sagemaker-core library
- Verify you're using the right shapes/resources

**Training fails with data errors:**
- Inspect your uploaded CSV files on S3
- Confirm target column is first, no headers
- Check data types are numeric

**Permission denied:**
- Ensure your CoreLabSession can access your execution role
- Verify S3 bucket permissions

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria (Test Yourself)
- [ ] Can you find your training job in the SageMaker console?
- [ ] Does the job complete with a "Completed" status?
- [ ] Can you see training/validation metrics in the logs?
- [ ] Is there a model.tar.gz file in your S3 output location?

## ‚ö° Assignment 2: Hyperparameter Tuning

### üéØ Your Mission
Use SageMaker's automated hyperparameter optimization to find better model parameters than your manual choices.

### ü§î The Challenge
Instead of guessing hyperparameters, let SageMaker try different combinations automatically and pick the best ones based on a metric you care about.

### üß† Concepts to Research

#### Understanding Hyperparameter Tuning
**Research Questions:**
1. What's the difference between Bayesian, Random, and Grid search strategies?
2. Why is early stopping useful in hyperparameter tuning?
3. How does SageMaker decide which metric values are "better"?

#### Architecture Components
**Key Classes to Investigate:**
- `HyperParameterTuningJob` - The main orchestrator
- `HyperParameterTuningJobConfig` - Strategy and limits
- `ParameterRanges` - What parameters to tune and their ranges
- `HyperParameterTuningJobObjective` - What metric to optimize

### üõ†Ô∏è What You Need to Build

#### 1. Define Your Optimization Target
**Your Task:** Decide what metric you want to optimize.

**Think About:**
- What metrics did your XGBoost training job output?
- Do you want to maximize or minimize your chosen metric?
- Which is more important for churn prediction: precision or recall?

**Hint:** Look at the logs from Assignment 1 to see what metrics XGBoost automatically outputs.

#### 2. Set Parameter Search Ranges
**Your Task:** Define which hyperparameters to tune and their ranges.

**Research This:**
- What do XGBoost parameters like `max_depth`, `eta`, `gamma` actually control?
- What are reasonable ranges for each parameter?
- Should you use `CategoricalParameter`, `IntegerParameter`, or `ContinuousParameter`?

**Strategy Question:** Start with 3-4 parameters. Why might tuning too many at once be problematic?

#### 3. Resource Management
**Your Task:** Balance exploration vs. cost.

**Consider:**
- How many total training jobs should you run? (Budget consideration)
- How many should run in parallel? (Time vs. cost tradeoff)
- What's a reasonable max runtime per job?

**Budget Reality Check:** Each training job costs money. How would you explain your resource choices to a manager?

#### 4. Reuse Your Training Job Definition
**Your Task:** Adapt your TrainingJob configuration for hyperparameter tuning.

**Key Insight:** The hyperparameter tuning job needs a "template" training job definition. Most settings stay the same, but hyperparameters become variable.

**Question:** Can you reuse the channels and other configs from Assignment 1?

### üîç Debugging Hyperparameter Tuning

**Tuning job fails immediately:**
- Check your objective metric name matches what XGBoost outputs
- Verify your parameter ranges are valid for XGBoost

**All training jobs get the same score:**
- Your parameter ranges might be too narrow
- Check if your metric is actually varying between runs

**Jobs are taking too long:**
- Reduce `max_runtime_in_seconds` per job
- Consider using fewer `num_round` in your parameter ranges

### üéØ Analysis Challenge
**Your Task:** Once tuning completes, figure out:
1. Which hyperparameters had the biggest impact?
2. How much did the best model improve over your Assignment 1 baseline?
3. Was the improvement worth the extra computational cost?

**Hint:** The tuning job object has properties to access the best training job and its details.

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria (Prove Your Understanding)
- [ ] Can you explain why Bayesian optimization is better than random search?
- [ ] Did your best model beat your Assignment 1 baseline?
- [ ] Can you identify which hyperparameters mattered most?
- [ ] Do you understand the cost implications of your tuning choices?

### üí∞ Cost Consciousness
**Real-World Consideration:** Hyperparameter tuning can get expensive quickly. In a real project:
- How would you justify the cost to stakeholders?
- What would be your strategy for balancing thoroughness vs. budget?
- How might you use local experimentation to reduce cloud costs?

## üîÑ Assignment 3: Batch Transform Job

### üéØ Your Mission
Process a large dataset of predictions efficiently without running a real-time endpoint.

### ü§î Why Batch Transform?
**Scenario:** You have 10,000 customers and need churn predictions for all of them. Running them one-by-one through an endpoint would be slow and expensive. Batch Transform processes them all efficiently in one job.

### üß† Key Concepts to Understand

#### When to Use Batch vs. Real-time
**Research Questions:**
1. When would you choose Batch Transform over a real-time endpoint?
2. How does cost compare between batch and real-time inference?
3. What are the latency differences?

**Real-World Scenarios:** Which approach would you use for:
- Monthly churn risk reports for marketing?
- A web app showing individual customer risk scores?
- Processing new customer signups overnight?

### üõ†Ô∏è What You Need to Build

#### 1. Create a Model Resource
**Your Challenge:** SageMaker needs a "Model" (not just training artifacts) to run batch inference.

**Research This:**
- What's the difference between a TrainingJob's output and a Model resource?
- Why does the Model need both an image and model_data_url?
- Which model artifacts should you use - from Assignment 1 or your best hyperparameter tuning job?

**Architecture Question:** A Model is like a blueprint. What does it specify?

#### 2. Prepare Test Data Correctly
**Your Task:** Create test data in the format XGBoost expects for inference.

**Critical Thinking:**
- Should your test data include the target column? Why or why not?
- What format does the XGBoost container expect for batch inference?
- How is this different from training data format?

**Common Mistake:** Including the target column in test data. Think about why this doesn't make sense.

#### 3. Configure Transform Job
**Your Task:** Set up the batch processing job.

**Key Classes to Research:**
- `TransformJob` - The main batch processing job
- `TransformInput` - How to specify your input data
- `TransformOutput` - Where results go
- `TransformResources` - What compute resources to use

**Optimization Questions:**
1. How do you choose the right instance type for batch jobs?
2. When might you use multiple instances for batch processing?
3. What happens if your job fails partway through?

#### 4. Handle the Results
**Your Task:** Access and interpret your batch predictions.

**Investigation Required:**
- Where exactly are your results stored?
- What format are the predictions in?
- How do the output file names relate to your input files?

### üîç Troubleshooting Guide

**Model creation fails:**
- Check that your model artifacts URI is valid
- Verify the training job completed successfully
- Confirm your image URI matches the training container

**Transform job fails immediately:**
- Verify your input data format (no target column, correct CSV structure)
- Check that your S3 paths are accessible
- Ensure your test data is in the same format as training data (minus target)

**No output files:**
- Check the transform job actually completed successfully
- Verify you're looking in the right S3 location
- Look at CloudWatch logs for the transform job

**Predictions look wrong:**
- Compare a few manual predictions with batch results
- Check if your test data preprocessing matches training data preprocessing
- Verify column order matches what the model expects

### üéØ Analysis Challenge
Once your job completes:
1. **Sanity Check:** Do your predictions make sense? (Values between 0 and 1 for probabilities?)
2. **Performance:** How long did it take? How does this compare to real-time inference?
3. **Cost Analysis:** Calculate the cost per prediction. How does this compare to running an endpoint?

### üí° Advanced Thinking Questions
- **Scalability:** How would you handle batch processing 1 million records?
- **Monitoring:** How would you set up alerts if batch jobs fail?
- **Automation:** How might you automate monthly batch prediction runs?

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria (Test Your Understanding)
- [ ] Can you explain when batch transform is better than real-time endpoints?
- [ ] Do your predictions make business sense?
- [ ] Can you find and interpret your output files on S3?
- [ ] Could you explain the cost and time tradeoffs to a business stakeholder?

### üìä Business Impact
**Real-World Question:** If you were presenting these batch predictions to a marketing team:
- How would you explain the prediction confidence?
- What actions would you recommend based on high churn risk scores?
- How often should batch predictions be re-run?

## üöÄ Assignment 4: Serverless Endpoint

### üéØ Your Mission
Deploy your model to a serverless endpoint that automatically scales from zero to handle real-time prediction requests.

### ü§î Serverless vs. Traditional Endpoints
**The Big Difference:** Traditional endpoints run 24/7 (you pay even when idle). Serverless endpoints scale to zero when not used and spin up on-demand.

### üß† Architecture Concepts to Master

#### Understanding Serverless Inference
**Research Questions:**
1. What are the cost implications of serverless vs. provisioned endpoints?
2. What is "cold start" and when does it matter?
3. When would you choose serverless over provisioned capacity?

**Real-World Scenario:** You're building a customer service chatbot that predicts churn risk. Usage varies dramatically - busy during business hours, dead at night. Which endpoint type makes sense?

### üõ†Ô∏è What You Need to Build

#### 1. Serverless Configuration Strategy
**Your Challenge:** Design the right serverless configuration for your use case.

**Key Parameters to Research:**
- `memory_size_in_mb` - How much memory does your model need?
- `max_concurrency` - How many simultaneous requests to handle?
- `provisioned_concurrency` - Should you keep any instances "warm"?

**Critical Thinking:**
- How do you balance cost vs. performance?
- What happens if you underestimate memory requirements?
- When is provisioned concurrency worth the extra cost?

#### 2. Endpoint Configuration Architecture
**Your Task:** Create an EndpointConfig for serverless deployment.

**Key Classes to Understand:**
- `EndpointConfig` - The deployment blueprint
- `ProductionVariant` - Configuration for your model variant
- `ProductionVariantServerlessConfig` - Serverless-specific settings

**Architecture Question:** Why does SageMaker separate EndpointConfig from Endpoint? What flexibility does this provide?

#### 3. Model Deployment Challenge
**Your Task:** Deploy your model and handle the deployment process.

**Investigation Points:**
- How long does serverless endpoint deployment take?
- What status transitions does the endpoint go through?
- How is this different from provisioned endpoint deployment?

**Monitoring:** How would you know if deployment failed? Where would you look for error logs?

### üß™ Testing Your Endpoint

#### Method 1: Low-Level Testing
**Your Challenge:** Use the raw SageMaker runtime to test your endpoint.

**Think About:**
- What data format does XGBoost expect?
- How do you handle the response from the endpoint?
- What error handling should you implement?

**Research:** Look up `sagemaker-runtime` client documentation. What methods are available?

#### Method 2: High-Level Testing
**Your Challenge:** Use the SageMaker Predictor class for cleaner testing.

**Advantages to Discover:**
- How does Predictor simplify the inference process?
- What serialization/deserialization does it handle?
- When might you prefer the low-level approach?

**Hint:** The assignment mentions "no boilerplate" - figure out what boilerplate the Predictor eliminates.

### üîç Debugging Real-Time Inference

**Endpoint fails to deploy:**
- Check your model artifacts are valid
- Verify memory allocation is sufficient
- Confirm your serverless configuration parameters

**Endpoint deploys but predictions fail:**
- Test your input data format - does it match training expectations?
- Check CloudWatch logs for the endpoint
- Verify you're not including the target column in test data

**Predictions are wrong:**
- Compare single predictions with your local XGBoost model
- Check if data preprocessing is consistent
- Verify column order matches training data

**Cold start issues:**
- How long is the first prediction taking?
- Would provisioned concurrency help?
- Is this acceptable for your use case?

### üéØ Performance Analysis Challenge
Once your endpoint is working:

1. **Latency Testing:** Time several predictions. What's the pattern?
2. **Scalability:** Try sending multiple concurrent requests. How does it handle load?
3. **Cost Modeling:** Calculate cost per 1000 predictions vs. a provisioned endpoint.

### üí∞ Business Case Development
**Your Task:** Justify your serverless configuration to stakeholders.

**Questions to Answer:**
- What's your expected request pattern (requests per hour/day)?
- How does serverless cost compare to provisioned for your usage?
- What's acceptable latency for your use case?
- How does this impact the customer experience?

### ‚úÖ Success Criteria (Demonstrate Understanding)
- [ ] Can you explain why you chose your memory and concurrency settings?
- [ ] Do you understand the cost implications of your configuration?
- [ ] Can you successfully get predictions using both testing methods?
- [ ] Could you troubleshoot inference issues using logs and monitoring?

### üöß Advanced Challenges (Optional)
- **Load Testing:** How many concurrent requests can your endpoint handle?
- **Cost Optimization:** What's the minimum viable configuration for your use case?
- **Error Handling:** How would you handle and retry failed predictions in production?
- **Monitoring:** What CloudWatch metrics should you monitor for a production endpoint?

### üìä Production Readiness Questions
Before deploying to production, consider:
- **Security:** How would you control access to this endpoint?
- **Monitoring:** What alerts would you set up?
- **Versioning:** How would you deploy model updates without downtime?
- **Scaling:** What if your traffic patterns change dramatically?

## üõ†Ô∏è A Better Way: CoreLabSession Utility

### ü§î Did You Notice the Patterns?

After completing the assignments above, you probably found yourself writing repetitive code:
- Building S3 paths with timestamps and project names
- Creating job names with consistent patterns  
- Managing execution roles and sessions
- Retrieving framework images with the same parameters
- Coordinating resource names across training, models, and endpoints

### üí° Introducing CoreLabSession

The `CoreLabSession` class encapsulates all these patterns you just learned to build manually:

```python
from corelab.core.session import CoreLabSession

# This replaces all the manual setup you did above
lab_session = CoreLabSession(
    framework='xgboost',
    project_name='your-name-essentials',  
    default_folder='essentials',
    create_run_folder=True
)
```

### üîç What CoreLabSession Provides

Now that you understand what happens under the hood, you can appreciate what this utility does:

**Session Management:**
```python
lab_session.core_session          # Your sagemaker-core Session
lab_session.role                  # Your execution role
lab_session.region                # Current AWS region
```

**Smart Path Management:**
```python
lab_session.base_s3_uri                    # s3://bucket/default_folder/timestamp/
lab_session.jobs_output_s3_uri             # s3://bucket/default_folder/timestamp/jobs/
lab_session.transform_output_s3_uri        # s3://bucket/default_folder/timestamp/transform_output/
```

**Consistent Resource Naming:**
```python
lab_session.training_job_name              # project-framework-timestamp
lab_session.tuning_job_name                # project-framework-tune-timestamp  
lab_session.model_name                     # project-framework
lab_session.endpoint_name                  # project-framework-endpoint
lab_session.serverless_endpoint_name       # project-framework-serverless-endpoint
```

**Framework Integration:**
```python
lab_session.retrieve_image('1.7-1')       # Gets XGBoost image for your region
```

### üéØ When to Build Your Own vs. Use Utilities

**Build Your Own When:**
- Learning how the underlying systems work
- Needing very specific customization
- Working with patterns not covered by existing utilities
- Building reusable components for your team

**Use Utilities When:**
- Following established patterns
- Focusing on the ML problem, not infrastructure plumbing
- Working on projects with time constraints
- Maintaining consistency across team members

### üí≠ Reflection Questions

Now that you've done both approaches:
1. **Complexity Management:** How much boilerplate did CoreLabSession eliminate?
2. **Error Prevention:** What mistakes would the utility help you avoid?
3. **Team Collaboration:** How would consistent naming conventions help in a team setting?
4. **Customization Tradeoffs:** When might the utility's conventions not fit your needs?

### üöÄ Building Your Own Utilities

Based on your manual experience, you now understand how to create similar utilities:
- **Identify repetitive patterns** in your code
- **Extract common functionality** into reusable classes
- **Provide sensible defaults** while allowing customization  
- **Handle the "plumbing"** so users focus on business logic

This is a key skill in production ML systems - knowing when and how to abstract complexity without hiding important details.

---
