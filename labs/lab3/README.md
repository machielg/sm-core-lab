# ðŸ”§ SageMaker SDK Components - Learning Guide

## ðŸ“– Introduction

This lab bridges the gap between individual SageMaker operations and full pipeline orchestration. You'll learn to use the **SageMaker Python SDK** - a higher-level abstraction than sagemaker-core - to work with the key components that make up ML workflows: processing, training, tuning, and model management.

**Learning Objectives:**
- Master the SageMaker SDK's high-level abstractions (Processors, Estimators, Tuners)
- Build production-ready preprocessing workflows
- Use Framework Estimators for flexible model training
- Implement automated hyperparameter optimization at scale
- Manage model lifecycle with Model Registry

**Prerequisites:**
- Complete Lab 1 (SageMaker Essentials with sagemaker-core)
- Complete Lab 2 (Bring Your Own Library)
- Understanding of the customer churn dataset
- Familiarity with scikit-learn and XGBoost

**Why This Lab Matters:**
- **Lab 1**: You learned the *low-level building blocks* (sagemaker-core)
- **This Lab**: You'll master *high-level SDK components* for production ML
- **Lab 4**: You'll *orchestrate these components* into automated pipelines
